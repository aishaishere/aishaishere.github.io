Scribe. It's Simple.

Scribe is a super simple pseudo-static site generator.

Just create a page in markdown, then push it to your server, S3 or dropbox account.

That's it. No building or compiling necessary.  Just visit index.html and Scribe does the rest. Sweet eh?

More features coming as soon as I sober up.

Want to contribute? Awesome. Just remember though, the goal of Scribe is to have no server side code execution - just plain ol' static file delivery.
