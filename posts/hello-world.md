# Hello World

This is the classic hello world post.

It's written in markdown, and parsed in the browser.  It lives at [/posts/hello-world.md](posts/hello-world.md).  Take a look.  Go on, look.

Creating a new post is easy.  Just create a markdown file in the '''posts''' directory, then push to git, ftp to server, or drag it to dropbox.

That's it.  Enjoy.
