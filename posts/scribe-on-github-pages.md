# Scribe + Github = Awesome

Using Github Pages to host Scribe is possibly the easiest way to get your blog up and running in the entire history of the universe.  Possibly.  Lets learn how to do it in three easy steps:

1.  Fork the the [Scribe](https://github.com/davekinkead/scribe) repo on Github.
2.  Rename your copy of the repo to `username.github.io`, and yes username is what ever _your_ github username is.
3.  Nothing.  There is no step 3!  Visit https://username.github.io to see your super sweet new blog.

Questions? Tough luck. If this is too hard you probably shouldn't be blogging :(
